In order to commit to repository:

* Go to the "Changes" tab
* Write a summary for your commit (ex. "Created Nathan README)
* Write a brief description (ex. "Created a text document to help Nathan with his broke-ass Github App)
* Press "Commit to master"

After it commits, NORMALLY you'd press "Sync" in the top right-hand corner, but your app is dumb, soo...

* Click on the gear in the top-right hand corner and press "Open in Git Shell"
* Type "git status"
* If there are no crazy conflicts, type "git push"

YA DONE.
